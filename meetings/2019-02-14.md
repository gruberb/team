## Working Group Updates
  - Status updates
    - tide
    - docs
  - All-hands recap
  - Add WG agenda items here‚Ä¶
    - Can we get alignment between Tide‚Äôs middleware and Tower‚Äôs middleware? 
    - Missing gaps in the ecosystem

## Revamping the structure of the WG

- Initially structured as three ‚Äúsub‚Äù WGs:
  - async
  - embedded
  - web
- Proposed structure
  - network foundations (lang/compiler/`std`)
  - network ecosystem

## Survey review

- Biggest takeaway: lack of documentation and examples is a major problem in the Rust async world right now
- People also want a ‚Äúone true framework‚Äù / more obvious default choice
- Still lots of gaps in the web ecosystem
  - client libraries for message queues
  - async database drivers
- Summary post
- aturon wants to review detailed responses to make an ‚Äúecosystem TODO list‚Äù

## Update on the state of networking

- Rust team All Hands
  - 3 sessions on Tide
    - mostly introducing people to Tide
    - some high-level API review
    - CSRF issues
  - 3 sessions on async + futures
    - No decision  yet  on final `await` syntax, but some progress on process to get there
    - session on futures 1.0 üëç 
    - futures RFC is in FCP

## Tide

- progress has been steady, even in absence of meetings
- API Design notes
  - we‚Äôd like to explore different API designs outside of extractors
    - Tide could move to a more ‚Äúlayered‚Äù structure, where each endpoint is `async fn(RequestContext) - > Response`.
    - A branch + writeup are planned to explore this direction further
  - We‚Äôre thinking of moving to a highly iterative approach, where we can release new Tide versions early + often
    - Create a split between ‚Äúcore‚Äù functionality, and ergonomics that can be layered on top
    - The plan will be laid out more concretely in issues/RFCs

## Async

- Concerns about how the process around futures and async/await has progressed ‚Äî  there‚Äôs a large disconnect between the public github threads and private discussions amongst team members, which feels bad for everyone

## Middleware ([http-service](https://docs.rs/http-service/0.1.1/http_service/) + [tower](https://docs.rs/tower/0.0.1/tower/))

- Lots of overlap between what these two crates are trying to do
- The http-service crate is intended to be framework-neutral, and collaboration is super important there
- However, there‚Äôs a lot of detail work to figure out how to fit this together in a way that works for Tide, Tower, and others
