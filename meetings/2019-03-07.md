## Working Group Updates
  - Status updates
    - tide
      - Core idea is to create the ‚Äúsmallest‚Äù core API as possible
      - The goals are:
        - Taking care of http-related concerns at ‚Äúsignature‚Äù level
        - Working with application types instead of http types
        - Current downsides of the extractor setup are dealing with wrapper types, some magic impls of the Endpoint trait which makes it overall hard to use and understand
      - @Aaron T is working on revamp to make it easier to use and understand
        - The goal is to write endpoints directly and extract data within the body instead of having various Endpoint impls for extractor arguments
        - Extractions (could) happen inside the endpoint body instead of getting passed as parameters. However, the seperation of http and application would weaken
        - Using attribute macros to extract parameters to keep the function bodies ‚Äúapp native‚Äù
        - @Aaron T will write up a lengthy proposal for this change (proposal). Generally great feedback from the working group
    - wg transition
      - We have rustasync GitHub handle
      - We fixed the blog and the urls
      - Still missing: rust-lang.org, discord and twitter, rustasync
        - Website: @yoshua w 
        - Twitter: @Aaron T 
        - Discord: @Aaron T 
        - rustasync: Will be an issue on GitHub
      - Need to give access rights to team members to transition ownership from private crate to rustasync
    - arewewebyet
      - Looking for maintainers and doing active curation within the team
      - Probably takes 10 minutes a week to keep it updated and curated
      - Long term vision: AWWY could be a key role in communicating, together with the working group and areweasync yet
    - areweasyncyet
      - Constant updates, need to get upsuper joining the next meeting
    - [2019 roadmap](https://github.com/rustasync/team/issues/96)
      - Read it and give feedback üòâ 
  - 6 week sprints
    - WASM WG is starting with 6 week sprint cycles (again)
    - Use this also for our working group to plan work in terms of time and setting goals
    - Having a road map according to the 6 week cycle
    - Creating an issue with first thoughts - [https://github.com/rustasync/team/issues/96](https://github.com/rustasync/team/issues/96)
  - Issue triage (org | tide)
    - No time left, first point on the agenda for next meeting
